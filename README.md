Welcome to my snake game demo project! This is a classic snake game that can be played with the arrow keys on keyboard.

**Features**  
At the beginning of the game, the snake is as small as possible. The snake is shown in green and the food is shown in red.
Score and levels. After each eaten food, 10 points are earned. Each time the score reaches 50 points, the current level increases.
Increasing the speed. After each level, the snake's speed gradually increases, making the game more difficult with each level.
After hitting one of the walls of the playing area, the game ends. The game starts again after pressing the "New game" button.
